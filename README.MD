# Bank account kata


Think of your personal bank account experience. When in doubt, go for the simplest solution

## Requirements

·        Deposit and Withdrawal

·        Account statement (date, amount, balance)

·        Statement printing

The expected result is a service API, and its underlying implementation, that meets the expressed needs.
Nothing more, especially no UI, no persistence.
